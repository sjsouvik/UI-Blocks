## Technology used

<b>Built with</b>

- HTML5

> We have used icons for this library from [ionicons](https://ionicons.com)

## Usage

To start using the components, please follow these steps:

Copy-paste the follwoing stylesheet `link` into `head` section of your web page before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ui-blocks.netlify.app/style.css" />
```

Some of our components require the use of JavaScript and icons to function and show some messages properly. Place the following script near the end of your page inside `body` tag.

```html
<script src="https://ui-blocks.netlify.app/script.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@5.4.0/dist/ionicons.js"></script>
```

Now, you can start using components like:

```html
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">
  primary button from UI Blocks
</button>
```
